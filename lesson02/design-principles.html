        <p>Google uses the design principle of white space on its site to add functionality and create a clean look. Upon entering the site the user is greeted by a clean, white page with few distractions. In the center, they find an unobstructed search bar. As a search engine, Google is well aware that its audience wants quick and easy access to the search bar. By using white space google has been able to make an appealing and highly effective homepage for their viewers.</p>

        <img src="lesson02/images/church-of-jesus.png" alt="Screenshot of Church of Jeusus Christ homepage">
        <p>The Church of Jesus Christ uses visual hierarchy on the site by including a large featured image as well as varying sizes of headers to add information and value to the page. This design creates visual interest and because of the layout, it encourages the user to scroll farther on their website. </p>

        <p>One Loved Babe is an online clothing store. As such featuring their products is an immediate necessity because it encourages the customer to keep interest and make a purchase. By using the rule of thirds in the header and cover photo they create an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere and feature their best-selling products which encourage the viewer to stay on the site and shop for things they'll love.</p>
